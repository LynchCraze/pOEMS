# **THE RIME: A CONFESSION**  
*"Because this isn’t about the albatross."*

## **I. THE WEDDING GUEST**  
The man’s hands were maps of scar tissue. *Burn scars.* Like someone had pressed his palms to a stove and left them there. He gripped the groom’s father by the lapel, breath reeking of salt and necrosis.  

“You’ll listen,” he said. Not a request. A fact.  

The father laughed—a wet, phlegmy sound—until the mariner leaned in, lips splitting like overripe fruit, and whispered:  

***“I ate the heart. Not the bird. The heart of God.”***

## **II. THE KILLING**  
They called it a bird.  

Wrong.  

It was a thing of tendons strung between wings, eyes like cracked marbles, and a scream that unstitched the crew’s sanity. When it landed on the deck, the cook pissed himself. The first mate gouged his ears with fishhooks.  

The mariner took a filleting knife to its throat.  

*“Bad luck,”* the crew hissed.  

So he made it worse.  

He peeled the albatross open. Not for meat. For the *ritual*.  

- **Feathers:** Stuffed into the captain’s mouth until his jaw dislocated.  
- **Bones:** Sharpened into shivs. Distributed like communion wafers.  
- **Heart:** Still beating. Swallowed whole.  

The mariner smiled. *“Now we’re all guilty.”*

## **III. THE CURSE (A LIST)**  
1. **Day 1:** The sails sagged. Not from lack of wind—from the weight of maggots raining from the sun.  
2. **Day 3:** The ship’s boy vomited his teeth. They skittered across the deck, spelling *LIAR* in Morse.  
3. **Day 5:** The crew’s skin sloughed off in sheets. They hung their flesh on rigging like prayer flags.  
4. **Day 7:** The sea thickened. Blood? Worse. *Pus.* A keloid scar on the horizon.  

The mariner’s punishment:  

**THE ALBATROSS REMAINED.**  

Not around his neck. *Inside.*  

He felt it thrashing behind his ribs, beak gnawing through his spleen. A wet *click-click-click* as it tunneled toward his throat.

## **IV. THE CREW RISES**  
They died, of course.  

But corpses don’t stay dead when the ocean’s a festering womb.  

The first mate came back first. His lungs bloomed from his mouth like carnations. *“Bless us,”* he gargled. *“Bless us and we’ll let you drown.”*  

The mariner refused.  

So they made him watch.  

- **The cook** peeled his own face off, fried it in lard, and force-fed it to the mariner.  
- **The captain** unspooled his intestines into a noose. Hung himself from the mast. Again. Again. Again.  
- **The ship’s boy** (now a thing of teeth and static) carved equations into the deck. *Proof* that God hated them.

## **V. THE ONLY PRAYER THAT MATTERS**  
The mariner knelt in the bile-sea, albatross bones knitting his spine into a question mark.  

A shape moved in the water. Serpents. But these weren’t snakes.  

They were *tongues.* Severed. Still screaming.  

He tried to bless them.  

His own tongue fell out.

## **VI. THE WEDDING**  
The mariner releases the father. The man stumbles back, collar damp with spittle and black ichor.  

*“Why tell me?”* he rasps.  

The mariner grins. A maggot wriggles between his teeth.  

***“Because you’ll repeat it. You’ll carve it into bathroom stalls. You’ll whisper it to your son’s bride tonight while she sleeps. And then…”***  

He presses a bone-shiv into the man’s hand.  

***“You’ll want to make someone else listen.”***  

The wedding guest runs.  

He’ll stop running when the itching starts. When the albatross eggs hatch in his lungs.  

When his skin starts to slide.
